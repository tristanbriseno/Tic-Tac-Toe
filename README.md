# Tic-Tac-Toe

Once you open the Tic-Tac-Toe app in your code editor you will need to open the index.html file with Live server.

You will then be presented with a screen that will ask you to choose whether you will play as player X or player O.

The game will then commence with you being player 1 whether you previously picked player X or player O.

After claiming a square, The A.I. will claim a square. Turn will alternate between the two of you this way until a victor is decided.

Finally, after the winner is decided you will be asked if you would like to play again. 

If you do want to play again, all you have to do is click the replay button.
